            <h1> About Jeff Kinney </h1> 
                <div class="line"> </div>
                <p>Jeff grew up in Fort Washington, Maryland, United States where he attended the Bishop McNamara High School. As a kid fond of reading, Jeff delightfully read books of authors such as Judy Blume, Beverly Cleary, Piers Anthony, and J.R.R. Tolkien. He went on to study at the University of Maryland at College Park during the early 90s. It was during his student life at the University that Kinney generated the idea of and created Igdoof, his famous comic strip which appeared in the campus newspaper, The Diamondback. The success of Igdoof encouraged Jeff to decide on being a cartoonist. In 1995 Kinney moved to New England.</p>
                <p1>In addition to topping the list of the New York Times bestselling author, Jeff Kinney’s name also appeared on the Times magazine’s list of 100 Most Influential People in the world. He won the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children’s Book Award in 2009. The award is proof of Kinney’s immense popularity among young readers since it is voted for by children. Preparing for another upcoming book, Jeff Kinney also works as an online game developer and designer. Amid his creations is the famous children’s website Poptropica.com. He resides in Plainville, Southern Massachusetts with his wife, Julie and their two sons, Will and Grant.</p1>
